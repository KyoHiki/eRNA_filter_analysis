# What is this page?
This page shows the raw data and R code to reproduce the analyses in Hiki & Jo (in preparation). 

   
# Objective  
In preparation.  
 
   
# Files
1. Rcode.md  
An example R code for analysis and visualization. This code requires an input dataset (i.e., "htseq_all_sample_count_filter.tsv" and "TIN_summary.xlsx").  
     
2. htseq_all_sample_count_filter.tsv  
This datasheet includes the raw count data of medaka genes in eRNA and skin RNA.

3. TIN_summary.xlsx
This datasheet includes the transcript integrity number (TIN) for medaka genes in eRNA and skin RNA.

4. Figs  
Figures generated from the R code.
